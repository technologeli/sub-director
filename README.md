# Sub Director

If you've been using YouTube for a long time, you probably have accumulated a
lot of subscriptions. They might span over all of your interests, but YouTube's
subscription list smashes them all together into one feed. That's exactly where
Sub Director comes in.

Sub Director allows you to create _lists_ of channels and view their uploads in
a subscription-like feed.
